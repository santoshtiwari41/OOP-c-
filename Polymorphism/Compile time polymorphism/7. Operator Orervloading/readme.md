In C++, we can make operators work for user-defined classes. This means C++ has the ability to provide the operators with a special meaning for a data type, this ability is known as operator overloading. For example, we can overload an operator ‘+’ in a class like String so that we can concatenate two strings by just using +. Other example classes where arithmetic operators may be overloaded are Complex Numbers, Fractional Numbers, Big Integer, etc.

Operator overloading is a compile-time polymorphism. It is an idea of giving special meaning to an existing operator in C++ without changing its original meaning.
Example:

       int a;
      float b,sum;
      sum=a+b;

Here, variables “a” and “b” are of types “int” and “float”, which are built-in data types. Hence the addition operator ‘+’ can easily add the contents of “a” and “b”. This is because the addition operator “+” is predefined to add variables of built-in data type only.
 

Now, consider another example

class A
{

};

int main()
{
      A   a1,a2,a3;

      a3= a1 + a2;

      return 0;
}

In this example, we have 3 variables “a1”, “a2” and “a3” of type “class A”. Here we are trying to add two objects “a1” and “a2”, which are of user-defined type i.e. of type “class A” using the “+” operator. This is not allowed, because the addition operator “+” is predefined to operate only on built-in data types. But here, “class A” is a user-defined type, so the compiler generates an error. This is where the concept of “Operator overloading” comes in. 
Now, if the user wants to make the operator “+” to add two class objects, the user has to redefine the meaning of the “+” operator such that it adds two class objects. This is done by using the concept “Operator overloading”. So the main idea behind “Operator overloading” is to use c++ operators with class variables or class objects. Redefining the meaning of operators really does not change their original meaning; instead, they have been given additional meaning along with their existing ones.
